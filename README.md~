# Android-YouTube-Background-Player

YT player which plays only audio in background.

This is agains YT terms of service and could not be present on Google Play Store; therefore, I have developed it just for personal purposes. 

Application provides mechanisms for searching videos and playlists on YT, as well as logging into a Google account in order to acquire private playlists, which normally cannot be accessed.
